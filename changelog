- Controllers are now the main handlers of requests, three major
  variants for HTML, REST and SOAP.

  dependency on libcrypto++
- Redesigned authentication, dropped HTTP digest and opted for JWT,
  added security_context class for managing all of this

  always stored if a valid access-token was detected.
- A bunch of fixes to make web application work behind a
  reverse proxy.

Version 4.0.0

- Major rewrite, may break code.
- Added a JSON parser and compatible internal object, is analogous
  to the version of nlohmann. Replaces the old element class in
  webapp.

Version 3.0.1

- added cast to uint32 in webapp-el to allow compilation on s390

Version 3.0

  done by the templated struct zeep::xml::struct_serializer. You can
  create a specialization for this struct to do something else than
  calling MyClass::serialize.
- xml::document now has serialize and deserialize members.
- A streaming input added, process_document_elements calls the callback
  for all elements that match a given xpath.

- changed authentication mechanism in webapp to allow multiple realms
- some small changes in writing out XML documents/xml::writer
- added line number to validation error messages
- process value tag of mrs:option tag
- el processing returns original string if it does not contain an expression
- in expression language, support var1[var2] constructs
- fix in writing doctype declaration
- insert/erase implementations of zeep::xml::node...
- fixed bug in el implementation (dividing numbers)
- extended log format of HTTP server to allow better awstat logs (using the
  extra fields for SOAP calls). Also writes the X-Forwarded-For client if any.
- Patches provided by Patrick Rotsaert: serializer for xsd:time and
  optional data types based on boost::optional.
- Split out log_request as a virtual method in http::server
- Added quick and dirty test for requests from mobile clients

- OPTIONS and HEAD support in web server

Version 2.9.0

- fix in el::object (mixing up uint64 and size_t)

Version 2.6.3

- Fix for stack overflow in delete large XML documents

Version 2.6.2

- Apparently the word size has changed on amd64/GNUC targets. I've
  switched to a more robust template selection algorithm for WSDL
  generation.

Version 2.6.1

  crashes when built as a shared library...

  it uses XHTML templates to fill in. It uses a script language
  to enable interaction with the C++ code.

Version 2.1.0

- support for HTTP/1.1
- added multiplication in xpath expression language... oops
- revised interface for container::iterator, now it is possible
  to use more STL and boost functions on a container directly, like:
  
  xml::container cnt = ...;
  foreach (node* n, cnt) { cout << n->name() << endl; }
