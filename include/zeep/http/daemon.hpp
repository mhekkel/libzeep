/// In UNIX a daemon is a process that runs in the background.
/// In the case of libzeep this is of course serving HTTP requests.
/// stderr and stdout are captured and written to the log files
/// specified and a process ID is store in the pid file which
/// allows checking the status of a running daemon.
